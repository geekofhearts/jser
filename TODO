DONE sort out unit testing

make server a deamonisable process, not an inline one.

break apart functionality into functions for testing.

parse a config file
  config file value: port
  config file value: web root

actually return the files in the web root, based on the HTTP request path.

404 when said file doesn't exist.

figure out a way to test VHOSTS

add support for VHOSTS each with their own web root
  config file value: vhosts array

add support for running node.js files as their own webserver instances, via e.g. index.js .

add support for bypassing the URL and always passing to index.js at the root.

if we get here, there will be cake.
